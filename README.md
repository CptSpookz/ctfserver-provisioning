# Setting up NIZKCTF's provisioner


## Download the required dependencies

The provisioner needs a few python3 dependencies to run:
* pwgen
* paramiko
* os_client_config

They are listed in `pip-requirements.txt`, just run `sudo -H python3 -m pip3 install -r pip-requirements.txt` to install the needed versions.
